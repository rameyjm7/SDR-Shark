# SDR-Shark
A React application with a python backend for SIGINT applications with applied ML using PyTorch and tensorflow

* Many changes will be coming soon *

This is an application I wrote before working on https://github.com/rameyjm7/ML-wireless-signal-classification

I will update the application to use some of these models and focus on performance improvements and building a foundation for a better app

For now, here is what is looks like: An SDR is streamed from the backend (python, SoapySDR) to the frontend (React).

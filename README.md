# SDR-Shark
A React application with a python backend for SIGINT applications with applied ML using PyTorch and tensorflow

* Many changes will be coming soon *

This is an application I wrote before working on https://github.com/rameyjm7/ML-wireless-signal-classification

I will update the application to use some of these models and focus on performance improvements and building a foundation for a better app

For now, here is what is looks like: An SDR is streamed from the backend (python, SoapySDR) to the frontend (React).

Analysis is done using python currently and decision trees are used to classify signal types based on characteristics such as center frequency and bandwidth
